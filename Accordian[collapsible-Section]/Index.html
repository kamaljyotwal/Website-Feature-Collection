          Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the base of PHP 3,
          changing the language's name to the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. The
          entire module was rewritten by a team of six programmers and then called PHP 3.0. The
          language gained popularity because of its active development environment and because it
          was free downloadable software. The concepts of Perl, Java and C have been implemented in
          PHP 3.0, making the language convenient to understand. PHP 3.0 has the ability to perform
          highly complex mathematical calculations and provide network information, simplifying the
          writing of a database-enabled Web page.

      <button class="button-main">PHP 5</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="text">
          In 2004, PHP 5 was released, powered by the new Zend Engine-II. PHP 5 included new
          features such as improved support for OOPS, the PHP Data Objects(PDO) extension (which
          defines a lightweight and consistent interface for accessing databases), and numerous
          performance enhancements.
          <br />
          In 2008, PHP-5 became the only stable version under development. Late static binding had
          been missing from PHP and was added in version 5.3. Many high-profile open-source projects
          ceased to support PHP 4 in new code as of February 5, 2008, because of the GoPHP5
          initiative,provided by a consortium of PHP developers promoting the transition from PHP 4
          to PHP 5. Over time, PHP interpreters became available on most existing operating systems,
          either by building them from the PHP source code, or by using pre-built binaries.

      <button class="button-main">PHP 6 and Unicode</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="text">
          PHP received mixed reviews due to lacking native Unicode support at the core language
          level. In 2005, a project was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by
          embedding the (ICU) library,and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this
          would cause major changes both to the internals of the language and to user code, it was
          planned to release this as version 6.0 of the language, along with other major features
          then in development.

        <p class="text">
          During 2014 and 2015, a new major PHP version was developed, which was numbered PHP 7. PHP
          7 is a major release of PHP programming language and is touted to be a revolution in the
          way web applications can be developed and delivered for mobile to enterprises and the
          cloud. This release is considered to be the most important change for PHP after the
          release of PHP 5 in 2004.
